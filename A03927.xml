            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Satisfaction grew apace. so God wrought in weaknes, and by weake meanes.

The party touched in conscience, whose zeale this was, had a hard censure for it, as spredding it rashly, and ignorantly, &amp; at the first, without ever making Master Calvin acquainted with it nor was this all that was laid to his chardge. Convicted of lightnesse and inconstancie, had well smarted for it, had hee not asked Master Calvin forgiuenesse, and with all at length (though with much adoe first) obtained it. And then Master Calvin intreated that the Senat would not deale too severely with him.</hi> In which practise many things come in the way worthy of special observation.

Lastly to conclude: in a point twixt our selues varied vpon, if there be a phrase in the Communion booke, which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue vsed, shoulde any late writer impugne it, the matter is not great.

                        <item>1 Because the kings most excellent Maiestie hath made it knowne, that there is a new translation of the old Bible in hand, we cānot without great preiudice to our selues sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to such places, as seeme vnto vs to be contrary vnto the original, and we hope shall be amended. <hi>viz.</hi> Psal. 105. v. 18.

                        <item>2 Where it is said in the preface of the Cōmuniō book, that nothing is ordained to be read but the very pure word of God the holy scriptures, or that which is evidently groū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4547:10"/>on the same, there are appointed to be read such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of th'apocripha, as we iudge contrary to the pure word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Tob. 12.15. &amp; Eccl. 24. v. 11.12. &amp;c.</item>
                        <item>3 Because there are certaine Chapters of th'apocripha appointed to be read in the booke of Common praier vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of holy scripture, contrary to the sixt article, which vnder the name of holy scripture vnderstādeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Canonical books of both testaments.</item>
                        <item>4 Because some excellent bookes and many most edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters in sundry pointes of our most holy faith are vpon a great penaltie appointed not to bee read: For no place is so fit to prooue and demonstrate that Christ vvas man indeede, the sonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; of <hi>David,</hi> the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and the stocke of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the seed promised, as the genealogies mentioned. Math. 1. &amp; Luk. 3. No place so fit to set forth that most comfortable argument of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual loue betwixt Christ &amp; his Church, as <hi>Salomons</hi> song, which for that cause is called of the holy Ghost the most excellent song. No place so fit to teach vs, what the state of the Church shalbe in this last age of the world, who is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techrist, what his rising, &amp; fal shalbe, what the glory of the new Ierusalē is, as those Chapters of the Revelation which are forbidden to be read and the other are aboue all other commanded to be read.</item>
                        <item>5 Because the booke of Common praier commandeth the signe of the Crosse in Baptisme, which seemeth vnto vs to be against the 2. commandement, &amp; is held as a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish errour to be punished in the vse of the Lordes supper, and is of the same nature with salt, oile, creame, &amp;c. which are abolished as superstitious.</item>
                        <item>6 Because we haue no warrant in the word to say, that children being baptised are vndoubtedly saved, as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4547:11"/>in the Rubricke before the catechisme.</item>

                        <item>8 Because we see not, how it may agree with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to commit the body of a notorious wicked mā, dying without tokens of repentance to the earth in sure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hope of resurrection to eternal life.</item>
                        <item>9 Because we know not how it agreeth to Gods word to desire God to grant any thing, which our praiers dare not presume to aske.</item>

                     <p>The Crosse is brought into the Sacrament of Baptisme by Antichrist, namely by Pope Clement the first, by his own device, and without any profitable vse, togither with oile, spittle, creame, and confirmed by Pope Sylvester. 1. Three of these are taken away to avoide superstitiō as was the wafer cake, why then should the fourth stand, and that in so high a place as in the Sacrament, which hath beene more abused then any of the rest, and is of the Papists wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, and is of weake Protestants esteemed a principall part of the Sacrament?</p>

                     <p>Jf it be said that by the Crosse, the childe as by a badge is dedicated to Christ Jesus, and to his service, this is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the same that Baptisme doth, and so it is made a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at least equal with Baptisme, which is against the word. Jn the Archbishop of Canterburies Articles in his ordinarie visitation, inquirie is made for Popish ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the Lords Supper to be punished, and the Crosse for one, &amp;c. Is crossing dangerous in one Sacrament, and is it so tollerable and commendable in the other?</p>
                     <p>Againe as it is cōmanded and is practised, the Minister
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4547:17"/>doth but mocke the people: for hee saith hee signeth the childe with the signe of the crosse.

All the Bishops said, who ever goeth against his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession or subscription, thus and thus he shal be dealt withal, &amp;c. And all subscribed. In the third councell of that name Ministers are forbid, much more private men, to rehearse praiers at the Communion table, before they had beene allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by very sufficent learned men.

                     <p>The crosse in baptisme is a stone of offence, but of their parts that so take it, because they mistake it. For they list not know, that our fathers, whose children we are if we doe beleeue, did commendably vse it aforetime in the primitiue Church established by such authority, as Christ in such cases for matters indifferent hath lefte vnto his spouse, and in that consideration requisit to be observed, til authoritie see occasion hereafter to remoue it, as nowe to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4547:77"/>retaine it. And no question had our <hi>dread Soveraigne King Iames,</hi> found as iust cause to abolish it, <hi>as Ezechiah</hi> the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen serpent, he would, and it appeareth hee would. We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the latest remembrance not yet a yeare since, <hi>whē our liege Lord sat, as relligious Constantine,</hi> or <hi>godly Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> to iudge, what might be said on both parts. And might good <hi>Ezechia</hi> haue found the brasen serpent freed frō abuse of incense, which the Jews offred, because of a divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they thought was in it, a toleration had beene insteed of a remoueall. There beeing not like cause to doe so in the crosse, the like is not done. This was it; in the Sacrament of the Lords supper, the crosse was vtterly abolisht, &amp; in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme not. First because not abused in the one, as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 2. not so anciently approved in those times that vvere nearest the daies of the Apostles. As for other obiections they are scarce worth examining.</p>

                     <p>THat <hi>private baptisme is not against the word of God,</hi> shal appeare in due place. But against your <hi>cōmuniō book</hi> (exhibited to the parlament in the late gracious <hi>Q. Elizabeths</hi> daies) we confesse it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. For there indeede (in the title of the order of baptisme) we finde you teach thus. <hi>The sacramēts are not ordained of God to be vsed, but in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the publike congregation, &amp; necessarily annexed to the preaching of the word as seales of the same.</hi> Which if you make for a principle of faith, we must gather that your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is convertible. <hi>No preaching no sacrament.</hi> Again <hi>no sacrament no preaching.</hi> So as in effect you must, &amp; doe imply, <hi>no baptism,</hi> nor <hi>Lords supper without a sermō.</hi> And again, <hi>That we must alway haue one or other sacrament still
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4547:103"/>administred, when there is a sermō, because sacraments</hi> are necessarily annexed to the preaching of the word, as seales of the same. But our cōfort it is, &amp; our harts reioicing that the doctrine of baptisme we preach is no way contrary to the word of God. So as it stands vs vpon to examin this of yours, which followeth, wherein we are accused: Private baptisme is against the worde of God: for sacraments by God are ordained to be publike actions.</p>
                     <p>The argument brought is weak, which must be thus cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. <hi>No publike actions to be performed in private. The sacrament of baptisme is a publike action therfore not to be performed in private.</hi> For with as forcible an argument a man may reason thus, <hi>no publike actions to be performed in private. Praier &amp; thāks-giving are publike actions,</hi> ergo <hi>not to be done privately,</hi> Grant theirs grant this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The argument is strong against thēselues, preaching the word of God in corners, and conventicles, as if it were a time of persecution, for the truth, or of the truth. <hi>No pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like actions to be performed in private preaching the word of God in the daies of peace, and of the gospel, a publike action.

To what ende is it thou take a wife, if God haue purposed you children you must needes haue them, and if he haue purposed you none, doe all you can, you shall haue none. One pin driuen out with another, both of them a sufficient proofe that our actions and counsels must not depend vpon vncertainties this way or that way, but by a stayed sure liue are to be ruled and ordred.

                     <p>Both these propositions must be warily vnderstood.

He answered hir not a word, and after much adoe, when hee spake, he spake nothing to her comfort, for he said. <hi>He was not sent, but to the lost sheepe of the bouse of Israell.</hi> And then afterwards notwithstanding her importunitie, he tould her it was not for a dogge to haue the childrens bread.

These thinges for asmuch as they are right in themselues they may rightly be praied for by the faithfull, although it please God otherwise to haue his sonne raigne among his enimies, his children exercised vnder the crosse &amp;c. For as <hi>Origin</hi> hath vpon like occasion. It is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of euerie faithfull man not to be willing to suffer anie griefe &amp;c. Wherefore be it, there is noe expresse promise, nay were we the persons, whome God by name had denied.

What doe we make two Casters? As, but one, and the same in a manifold manner. For as the Sunne ariseth alway, and we doe not say many Sunnes, but one Sunne dayly ariseth, so the Pasch or Easter is alway consummated, and seeing it is alway celebrated it is one for the matter of our solemnitie. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> vpon another occasion exemplyfieth his answere by the speech here questioned, and then in vse. When Easter is at hand we say to morrow or the <hi>next day</hi> after <hi>to be</hi> the Passion of the Lord, where it is a many yeeres <hi>agoe</hi> since, that he suffered, neither could that Passion of his be more then once. Againe, on the <hi>Lords day</hi> we say this <hi>day</hi> the Lord rose againe, whereas many yeares are gone and past since he rose. Why is none so foolish (saith this graue Father) to tell vs in speaking so we lye, but that we call those daies after this fashion, for the like is now done, that was done heretofore.

As for the other sacrament of the

Although I will not greatly contend, yet to tel you my minde freely, I say there is <hi>a double fault</hi> or blemish in those churches, which vse rather <hi>vnleauened, then leauened bread.</hi> First because it sauoureth of <hi>Iudaisme, 2.</hi> because <hi>it is lesse fitted</hi> to the analogie and proportion of <hi>our ordinarie bread.</hi> True it is Christ blessed <hi>vnleauened bread, because at that time he ordained his</hi> supper, when indeede the Jewes might vse no other. So as we may retort y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> argument: If Christ in this supper vsed such bread, as they then vsed, we must do so to; <hi>But he vsed cōmon ordinarie bread thē,</hi> &amp; therefore we must vse ordinary bread. Now our ordinary &amp; vsual <hi>bread</hi> is <hi>leauened</hi> therefore also is it that we vse such. As if he implied thus much. Be it <hi>Christs action is our imitation;</hi> We denie not, but euen in our <hi>bread</hi> we imitate Christ, not in that very particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ours is leauened, but in the generall because ours is such, as is ordinary, for so was christs. The sum, &amp; substance of w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> answer may iustify our denial of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> minor which is here vrged, namely y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> our <hi>kneeling crosseth the practise of our sauiour.</hi> For christs actiō &amp; gesture is followed, if in the general drift we do, as he did, though not in that special strict māner as he did. Which interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiō rightly conceiued pleadeth our case thus far. <hi>Christ &amp; his A postis did that, which the custome both of those times &amp; of their coūtry made vsual, we do now that, which the custome
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4547:154"/>of our church of along time hath made vsuall.</hi> It was their wonted guise to fit at meate so, and so as before, it is our ordinary fashiō to knéel in praier, because though a bāquet we assemble at, yet heauenly, diuine, spiritual it is, not a méere corporal banquet, as if eating were all we came for, but strengthning of our faith, sealing vp in our harts forgiuenesse of sins, and the like spirituall graces we come for at that time, and therefore we <hi>pray, kneele,</hi> confesse our sinnes, and sing Psalmes, and all little inough, no way crossing the practise of our Sauiour more in this, then in the vse of <hi>leauened bread</hi> in time of the Sacrament, but here in following our Sauiour, because he did what the vse of his times and Countrie made fit, and decent, we what decencie, and custome of our times, and Countrie hath now made vsuall, and conuenient.</p>

The place, the time, the person all plead that his action was lawfull, and good, neither doth any man say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie hereunto: So farre of are we from reproouing what he did. For it was in a Chamber, and after they had supped, being not then risen from the bord, and our Sauiour himselfe was greater then any constitution of our Church since. At which time no doubt himselfe, and his presence might dispence with the Apostles for their gesture of sitting: which being but a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance might be afterwards, as wel altered, as other circūstances
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4547:155"/>of time, and place, and number of persons, or the like. For not long after, these were all altered, as we sée them at this day. Our Sauiour might doe that well, which we cannot so well. Any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different gesture might beséeme his person, because without sin, yet chose he to frame himselfe to the rites of his countrey for that action at that time. He commended his demeanour, and not his demeanour commended him. With vs it is farre otherwise. We are sinners, we come to confesse our sinnes, and to craue pardon for the same, in token whereof is our humiliation, by knéeling, &amp;c. None of all which needed Christ to doe. Such ods there is in regard of our selues, who are not, as Christ was to giue, but to receine, and doe differ as much as the Master, &amp; the Disciple, a mercifull Sauiour, and a polluted sinner, a Law giuer as then he was, and a Law receiuer, for so we are. Were a Scripture as ready at their hands for to proue ceremony of sitting, which some vrge, as there is in time of fasting to annoint our head, and wash our face,<note place="margin">

                     </q>
                     <p>A strange definition of <hi>Idolatrie.</hi> For then by that recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning if a man <hi>kneele,</hi> his Bible lying before him, he is an <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi> at the raising vp of <hi>Tabitha</hi> must be so charged. for he <hi>kneeled</hi> on his knées and turning himselfe to the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy said <hi>Tabitha</hi> arise: yea then may we not <hi>kneele</hi> at any time. For how can we knéele but it is before some creature in heauen, or in earth, either Angels themselues; or our bréethren, &amp; sisters where we are and liue, or the roofe, and wals, and whole edifice where we pray, vnlesse peraduenture these are not to be thought creatures, but must be stiled by some other name. Againe, where it is obiected that <hi>bowing</hi> before a creature in the matter of Gods worship is a breach of the second Commandement, it is very materiall to know, what they meane by these words <hi>(in a matter of Gods worship.)</hi> If they meane the time, or place of diuine seruice, sure we are, that <hi>kneeling</hi> is expedient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our humilitie in the houre of solemne prayer, which then is performed by the Communicants. If they meane bowing to, or before a creature it selfe in a matter of Gods worship (that is) exhibiting diuine worship vnto the creature, which is due vnto God, they knowing that we detest Idolatrie, know also that we detest that doctrine. But if in the time of the words of holy insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution then pronounced, they call the Elements of Brend and Wine Popish Images, or Idols, and estéeme our bowing to be no other, but Idolatrous at such time, as that blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is administred: of the two we had rather be held (though falsly) superstitious, then (truely) prophane for so speaking, and yet to the glory of God we may, and doe proclaime our vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of all superstition, &amp; prophanenesse. As for the meaning
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4547:157"/>of the second Commaundement, hitherto alwaies we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood this clause <hi>(Thou shalt not bow downe to them nor worship them,)</hi> to forbid vs worshiping or bowing downe to them, which God there mentioneth, such as we make vnto our selues either grauen, or the likenesse of some such in heauen or in earth. Now we demand whither those sacred Elements are of our making, or doe we make them to our selues, or be they grauen, or doe we bow downe to them? If so: hold vs Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and pertake not with vs in that sinne. But being not so, estéeme of vs as the Ministers of Christ, and faithfull disposers of those holy mysteries. The summe of all is, Our bowing at that time is an outward reuerence (we thinke) méete should be perfourmed, because of that holy action, which is then in hand, namely a religious communicating of that blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the very body and blood of our Lord Iesus, partly to stirre vp in others a more religious estimation of those diuine seales;<note place="margin">Seiungimusnes ab Epicureis cō tempteribus mysteriorum, excitamus ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>No good argument to conclude from a signe to a sacrament; as if because wee hold imposition of handes a <hi>significant action</hi> therefore we ascribe that vnto it, which is proper to the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

May it bee a signe of commending vnto God without derogation to the sacraments, and shall it not be as lawfull to certifie of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour? Hitherto we haue alwaies thought, that they who are commended vnto God by prayer (as at this time they are) haue a sure euidence, that they are the Lords. The verie order of the wordes whence it pleaseth some to take this their exception doth sufficiently cleare both, what our church doth, and what her purpose is herein. It is not the <hi>bare imposition of hands,</hi> as if y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> had power of it selfe to giue such a certificate. Solemne prayers are made be the Bishop ouer the childe, yea praiers are doubled, trebled, then this ceremonie annexed withall for a visible signe and not a sacramentall signe, which consisteth of some outward earthlie element as breade, and wine &amp;c. but <hi>signe</hi> in this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is <hi>signe</hi> of what the Bishoppe doth and the partie baptised vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth is done, which is to such a one a plaine certificate, that he hath had Gods singular fauour reuealed vnto him, in that of an infant of a day olde, hee is brought to some competent measure of knowledge of God his grace, and wil, as also in that he is vpon examination confirmed, and certified by his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent father in God, who is able to iudge, and accordinglie so doth, how, and how far forth hee is grounded in the necessarie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of true religion.</p>

The sequell of the Maior proposition wee vtterly dente (that is) It doth not follow that wee detract from the sufficiencie of Christ his institution, if wee approue of the bringing in this ceremonie of imposition of handes.

For it relieth on promises, concerning the gift of perseuerance, and the grace of confirmation. This rite (saith he) would bring much profit to the edefying of youth, and of the whole Church, and were also agreeing to Scripture and purer antiquitie. For in the <hi>Apostolicall laying on of hands</hi> was a triall of doctrine and profession of saith. <hi>Act. 19.</hi> and of exhortation to perseuerance, and of confirmation by the word in the doctrine and faith.

                        <hi>personall</hi> for the day before, at what time this con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference was had, a minister be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuented did confesse at the mariage of his daughter, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired hir to take the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on booke, which shee did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly and without anie spiritual guide to informe hir (contrarie to our church order set downe) hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the booke in hir hand, did publicklie and audiblie read the wordes, wherein hir consent is required. Which noueltie pleased the father so well, as he would needes aske his parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, whither that were not far better, then the other fashion of pronouncing them after the minister, hee reading the wordes, and directing the couples by them. So as if the obiection here
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4547:177"/>made haue strength, it mightily ouermatcheth this practise of some one, who hath fellowshippe in other points of opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our ecclesiasticall canons and order. The <hi>reall</hi> answer to purpose was, and is thus. First none could giue instance that any other did it but the minister, the rest of the congregation pronoūcing that generall confession, word for word after him. But if so it were (as the booke to their vnderstanding pretends a libertie, yet no offence at all for any one of the congregation publickely to read an inditement drawne against his owne soule. For so that confession is, wherein the people are deepely ingaged. Where it handling the kay of opening the kingdome of God by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie of his word, that the Rubricke should say <hi>This sentence of absolution be pronounced by man or woman, or anie one of the Communicants,</hi> then were iust cause to be taken against it. But the truth is, the booke wisely prouideth that the priest or Bishop being present shall vpon confession first made, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe to the people say &amp;c. Well knowne it is that in the vniuersities, our colledges, &amp; schooles of learning appoint in time of diuine seruice, certaine choristers or scholers to reade chap. say praiers, sing the letanie, and such like. All which so done by such, is performed all that while by other then profest ministers, that haue taken orders. As for the inforced conclusion <hi>(That we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit weomen to speake openlie)</hi> proueth no such thing: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did it; No such aduantage. For weomen are to speake iointlie with the whole congregation whereof they are a part, or els how shall they sing Psalmes, and seueral alone by themselues, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion may bee offred, whither at the lauer of regeneration when they became sureties and Godmothers for little ones then to be baptised, or to make answer at the solenmization of mariage, when as their husbands for their part promise to take them to wiues, and they againe in like words say asmuch on their owne behalfe audibly, and aloud, that the rest of the congregation may witnesse the publicke vow each of them make to one another. Wherefore it cannot bee thought scandalous, if neede so require, that a confession bee made in the name of all those that receiue the holy communion, either by one of them (as this obiection wil needes haue it thought) man or woman, or else by any of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. For as it appeareth in storie the manner was, that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4547:177"/>weomen hauing publickely offended, the church required publick proose of their vnfained repentance, both by word and deed.

One <hi>Simon Goulartius,</hi> whom we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged in his notes vpon <hi>Cyprian</hi> writeth thus. <hi>The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in ordaining of Ministers of the Church we commend so they be rightly and with edification obserued.</hi> But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments we deny them to be as which (that is) because they obtaine not a vniuersall vse. For neither are all to be ordained, but all are to be baptized and being baptized, when they are in yeares they must come to the Table of the Lord. Doe men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4547:182"/>this reasō giuen by others, and will they not take reason at our handes. What is this but like wantons that will haue no bread at any ones hande, but such a one, or such a one they fancy; though it be deliuered them as kindelie, cut from the same loafe that others giue. But because children make orts, and are sicke of the wantons, they haue a rod otherwhiles and the bread taken from thē and all little inough to bring downe their stout stomack glad afterwards to leape at a crust &amp; to prize husks &amp; hogs wash as the vnthrift did, when he was in a strange country: We néed not apply it, they are of vnderstanding, whome wee make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto: God giue them as inward and inlie a feeling of that we know they well vnderstand. This third interpretation wee adde from their mouth, whose presence neare his highnesse person may giue assurance of a truth. The word <hi>necessarie</hi> hath a twofold signification. One more large, the other more strict. Large as that which is necessarie vpon supposition if it may wel bee, strict with cut supposition as that it must needes bee what ere come of it.

                     <p>True in deede it is, that some shall be reserued till that time, &amp; suddainly changed, yet that no exception, because suddaine death shal be to some persons, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> therefore none shal pray against it. For it needs must be, that heresies shall come, yet that no hinderance
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4547:187"/>why we should not doe all diligence by prayer, studie, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the word of God, or any other good holy meanes to stop them. And if the Lord shall dispose of any of vs, (otherwise, then in the point we intreate of) calling vs on the <hi>suddaine,</hi> as he hath done many good men, yet to pray against it, is no disobeying the Lords will, which is his owne secret, and vnknowne to vs. For if a man may wish contrarie to that which he knoweth will fall out, so may he be otherwhiles extraordinarily affected, and yet in a holy manner, as did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> desiring himselfe to be cut off,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> so his kinsmen in the flesh all <hi>Israel</hi> might be saued, yea if a man in the earnestnesse of his loue, may wish contrary to that, which he seeth already come to passe, as appeareth in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he <hi>would</hi> he were with the <hi>Galathians,</hi> whereas he then was absent,<note place="margin">Galath. 4.20.</note> and in that very instant could not at once be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; we sée not, but a man praying against suddaine death, may be farre from iust reproofe, specially, when a man knoweth not ought to the contrary, touching himselfe, and if he did know, or notwithstanding this particular clause should die suddainely, yet his prayer made in what manner the Church giueth direction, is not so much <hi>distributiuely</hi> in his owne person, as <hi>collectiuely</hi> in the name of the whole congregation. For the foote of the answere is not <hi>deliuer</hi> me good Lord, but <hi>deliuer</hi> vs. The effect of which petition howsoeuer some one person may misse of in the particular of suddaine death, yet the greater part doth not. And although he that dieth suddainely, may haue his prayer frustrated in that one point, yet some other way it taketh place, namely, that he be neuer <hi>vnprepared</hi> for death. So as in a word to cut off all controuersies, &amp; meete withall exceptions, this may giue full contentment to a peaceable, honest hart, that when we pray against <hi>suddaine</hi> death we pray against <hi>vnprepared</hi> death. And howsoeuer it may preuent a kindly opportunitie for mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string of comfortable instructions to our selues, and others, which we might yeelde vpon respite giuen by sicknesse, yet the substance of that clause is, that <hi>suddaine</hi> death may in no case preuent vs of the glorious inheritauce prepared of God for the Saints.</p>

First, a brother was to raise vp seede to his brother that died without issue: Secondly, children borne of both wines at once were legitimate, which could not be if poligamie (that is) pluralitie of wives at once had beene the sin of adulterie.

Anone after. <hi>VVell therefore and according to the will of God, the holy Fathers haue giuen in charge that there be celebrated a perpetuall memorie of them as dying for the Lord.</hi> No new deuise in his time but long before as it appeareth by his writing. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> or the Author vnder his name. Behold these little ones, (whom <hi>Herode</hi> the enemy of nature and and monster of crueltie did kill) are suddainly become Martyrs, and whilest in steede of Christ, and for Christ pulled from their mothers breast and slaine they beare witnesse by suffering, what they could not by their speech. All which testimonies as they are nothing, if Scripture were against them, so the Scripture no where gainsaying, we shall doe ill to gainsay the testimonie of so many ages succéeding one another, and that for many hundred yeares confirming what (but lately) is denied without sufficient proofe to the contrary. And yet though lately denied by some few among vs (not to speake of our own Church here at home) other our brethren in the same faith learned writers of these times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the order we do. <hi>Spangenbergius</hi> as may be seene in his postill they of <hi>Merdenburg</hi> in their Centures note that God <hi>by this heauie Tragedie hath shaddowed out the bloody image of Christs Church.</hi> Which historie of theirs would not fit to such a purpose, if their were no comparison twixt them and the Church of Christ. Master <hi>Gualter</hi> in his <hi>18.</hi> Homily vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> writes thus. <hi>As <hi>Abel</hi> was the first Martyr of the olde Testament, whose blood cried vnto God, so these infants were the first, which were slaine in the newe Testament for Iesus Christ and crowned with a glorious crowne of Martyrdome, haue changed this mortall life for an immortall, and now liue with him in the heauens.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all these auncient and late authorities this argument may

They in whom Christ is perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and put to death may be held for Martyrs: But in those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent children Christ was persecuted and put to death. (For such was the tyrants purpose, and so Christ accounteth what is done to little ones for his sake as done vnto him.)

Preindice of all, If all things here obiected be contrary to the word of God, as some make shew for, in steede of our yea, write nay, and for our nay write yea: Then iudge whether such a course

God forbid it should so be, and we pray the Lord &amp; thy selfe that thou apply thy hart to wisedome, least thou be deceiued. And deceiued thou art, if thou so thinke or write. But let thy censure be, as God shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thy hart: in iudgement feare it is, if thou continue obstinate, in mercie know it is, if thou incline to this counsell giuen. And that thou so doe, the Lord graunt thée his spirit of wisedome and humilitie, that (as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speakes) thou receaue our exhortation in méekenesse of wisedome: More expect not at our hands. For we cannot possiblie wish thée more, but grace in this life, and glorie in the life to come. Our pen may be tired, and our wish at an end, but no end we wish of thy good. For the good we wish, is thy endlesse saluation.</p>
